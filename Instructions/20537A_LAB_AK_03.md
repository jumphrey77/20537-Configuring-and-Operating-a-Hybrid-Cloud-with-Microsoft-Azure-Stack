Module 3: Deploying Microsoft Azure Stack

Lab: Confirming prerequisites and installing Microsoft Azure Stack

### Exercise 1: Confirming the Prerequisites

####   Task 1: Confirm the CPU meets the requirements

1.  On **MAS-HOST01**, click **Start**, then right-click **Windows PowerShell
    a**nd then More, then click **Run as administrator**.

2.  In the **User Account Control** dialog, click **Yes**

3.  In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** Console enter the following
    PowerShell command and press Enter:

'''
Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Processor -Property Name,
SecondLevelAddressTranslationExtensions, VirtualizationFirmwareEnabled,
VMMonitorModeExtensions \|
Format-List Name, SecondLevelAddressTranslationExtensions,
VirtualizationFirmwareEnabled, VMMonitorModeExtensions
'''

4.  In the information that is returned, review the following:

-   SecondLevelAddressTranslationExtensions

-   VirtualizationFirmwareEnabled

-   VMMonitorModeExtensions

5.  Enter the following PowerShell command and press Enter:

(Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Processor).Count

6.  Ensure the number returned is **2** or higher.

7.  Enter the following PowerShell command and press Enter:

'''
Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Processor -Property Name, SocketDesignation,
NumberOfCores, NumberOfEnabledCore, NumberOfLogicalProcessors \| Format-List
Name, SocketDesignation, NumberOfCores, NumberOfEnabledCore,
NumberOfLogicalProcessors
'''

8.  Ensure the **NumberOfCores** for each CPU returned is **6** or higher.

9.  Leave the **Administrator: Windows PowerShel**l Console open.

####   Task 2: Confirm the number of drives

1.  In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** Console on **MAS-HOST01** enter
    the following **PowerShell** command and press Enter:

'''
\$DiskIndexes = Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_DiskPartition \| Where-Object
-FilterScript {\$_.BootPartition -eq \$true} \| Select-Object -ExpandProperty
DiskIndex
'''

2.  This will obtain the **Disk Index** of the disk partitions that are part of
    the boot process, whether they be VHDX file or physical disk.

3.  Enter the following **PowerShell** command to see the Disk Indexes and press
    enter:

'''
$DiskIndexes
'''

4.  Enter the following PowerShell command and press Enter:

'''
Get-PhysicalDisk \| Where-Object -FilterScript {\$DiskIndexes -notcontains
\$\_.DeviceID} \| Format-Table FriendlyName, OperationalStatus, HealthStatus,
\@{Name="Size";Expression={(\$_.Size / 1GB).ToString() + " GB"}}
'''

5.  This shows the disks that are not part of the operating system boot process.
    You should have at least 4 disks listed.

####   Task 3: Confirm the quantity of memory

1.  In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** Console on MAS-HOST01 enter the
    following **PowerShell** command and press Enter:

'''
\$Memory = (Get-Ciminstance Win32_OperatingSystem \| Select-Object
-ExpandProperty MaxProcessMemorySize) /1GB
'''

2.  Enter the following **PowerShell** command to see the amount of memory
    installed and press enter:

'''
\$Memory
'''

3.  To round the number, enter the following **PowerShell** command and press
    enter:

'''
[math]::Round(\$Memory,0)
'''

4.  This will display the amount of memory in **GB**.

5.  Close the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** window.

**Results**: After this exercise, you should have confirmed the hardware on
which the Azure Stack Development Kit is to be deployed meets the prerequisites.

### Exercise 2: Confirm the installation was successful

####   Task 1: Ensure both the Tenant and Admin Portals are functioning

1.  On **MAS-HOST01,** open Internet Explorer.

2.  Browse to https://adminportal.local.azurestack.external

3.  Sign into **Azure Stack** with the following credentials:

-   Username: **AzureStack\\AzureStackAdminX**

-   Password: **Pa55w.rd**

4.  In the **Microsoft Azure Stack - Administration**, page that opens, click
    **More Services**.

5.  Under **Administrative Resources** click **Resource Providers**.

6.  In the **Resource Providers** blade, ensure the following **Resource
    Providers** are listed:

-   Compute

-   Health

-   KeyVault

-   Network

-   Storage

7.  Open a new tab in **Internet Explorer** and browse to
    **https://portal.local.azurestack.external**

8.  In the navigation pane, click **More services**.

9.  Confirm the list of **Services** returned include the following:

-   Dashboard

-   Resource groups

-   All resources

-   Tags

-   Recent

-   Subscriptions

-   Marketplace

-   Resource explorer

-   Portal settings

-   Audit logs

10.  Close the **https://portal.local.azurestack.external** tab that was opened.

####   Task 2: Ensure no critical alerts are present in Azure Stack

1.  In the **Microsoft Azure Stack – Administration** portal on **MAS-HOST01**,
    click **More services**.

2.  Under **Administration** click **Region Management**.

3.  In the **local** blade that opens, click the **Overview** tab.

4.  Review the following sections and confirm there are no **Critical** alerts
    displayed:

-   Alerts

-   Updates

-   Resource Providers
